# Event_Planner_Android_Java

This app is to help customers plan an upcoming event or party be it personal or
public. It is assumed that this app is created for a small organization/startup that
helps customers to arrange planning and executing the event/party. The app
displays various events and themes which they could use to choose as per their
choice. Once chosen, the page giving you a small description and image on how
the theme looks and what we do to make it work is given for the user’s
understanding. There are few questions the user needs to answer as a part of
availing the services. Once the options are selected and booking is taken, a
confirmation page is displayed with the amount payable on the day of service.
This app is designed and created as an original mobile app for the Android OS
platform using the Java programming language with the Android Studio IDE.
